# Solution  

## Observation  

This problem is similar to **Leetcode 27: Remove Element**, as it also requires two pointers for traversal and in-place modification.  

However, the key difference here is that instead of checking against a given value (`val`), we compare each element with the last unique element stored in the array (`nums[left - 1]`).  

Since the array is already sorted, all duplicate elements will be adjacent. This means we only need to check if `nums[right]` is different from `nums[left - 1]`. If it is, we update `nums[left]` and move `left` forward.

## Implementation  

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        """
        Removes duplicates in-place from a sorted array and returns the new length.
        """

        left = 1  # Pointer for the next unique element position
        for right in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[right] != nums[left - 1]:
                nums[left] = nums[right]
                left += 1
        return left  # The length of the unique elements
```

## Debugging Example  

### Input:  
```python
nums = [2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5]
```

### Execution Steps:  

| Step | left | right | nums                           |
|------|------|------|----------------------------------|
| 1    | 1    | 1    | [2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5] |
| 2    | 1    | 2    | [2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5] |
| 3    | 2    | 3    | [2, 3, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5] |
| 4    | 2    | 4    | [2, 3, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5] |
| 5    | 3    | 5    | [2, 3, 4, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5] |
| 6    | 4    | 6    | [2, 3, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5, 5] |
| 7    | 4    | 7    | [2, 3, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5, 5] |

### Output:  
```
New length of nums: 4
Modified nums: [2, 3, 4, 5]
```
