# Solution  

## Observation  
The simplest approach to solving this problem is to iterate through all elements of `nums` and store elements that are not equal to `val` in a separate result array. However, this method increases complexity due to the additional space required for the new array.  

A more efficient approach is to use two pointers:  
- `fast`: Scans through all elements in the array.  
- `slow`: Marks the position where the next valid element should be placed.  

Instead of using an additional array, we modify `nums` in place by shifting valid elements forward. This approach minimizes space complexity and avoids unnecessary list operations like `append`.

## Implementation  

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def removeElement(self, nums: List[int], val: int) -> int:
        """
        Removes all occurrences of 'val' from 'nums' in place and returns the new length.
        """
        slow = 0
        for fast in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[fast] != val:
                nums[slow] = nums[fast]
                slow += 1
        return slow
```

## Debugging Example  

### Input:  
```python
nums = [3, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6]
val = 3
```

### Execution Steps:  

| Step | slow | fast | nums                           |
|------|------|------|----------------------------------|
| 1    | 0    | 0    | [3, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6] |
| 2    | 1    | 1    | [2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6] |
| 3    | 2    | 2    | [2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6] |
| 4    | 2    | 3    | [2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6] |
| 5    | 3    | 4    | [2, 2, 4, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6] |
| 6    | 3    | 5    | [2, 2, 4, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6] |
| 7    | 4    | 6    | [2, 2, 4, 5, 4, 3, 5, 6] |
| 8    | 5    | 7    | [2, 2, 4, 5, 6, 3, 5, 6] |

### Output:  
```
New length of nums: 5
Modified nums: [2, 2, 4, 5, 6, 3, 5, 6]
```
