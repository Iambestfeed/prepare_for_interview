Hereâ€™s the refined version of your explanation in English, along with a corrected implementation for **"Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II"** (which allows at most two occurrences of each number).

# Solution  

## Observation  

This is a more complex version of **Leetcode 26: Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array**, with the additional requirement of allowing at most **two** occurrences of each element.  

Since the array is **sorted**, we can use the following observations:  
- If a number appears **less than twice**, checking `nums[i]` and `nums[i+2]` will ensure the correct condition.  
- If a number appears **more than twice**, we only keep the **first two occurrences** and discard the rest.  

To achieve this, we can use **two pointers**:  
- `left`: The position where the next valid element should be placed.  
- `right`: The position scanning through the array.  

The key condition is:  
> If `nums[right] != nums[left - 2]`, then `nums[right]` should be included in the result, since it ensures at most **two** occurrences are kept.

## Implementation  

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        """
        Removes duplicates in-place from a sorted array but allows at most two occurrences.
        Returns the new length of the modified array.
        """

        left = 2 
        for right in range(2, len(nums)):
            if nums[right] != nums[left - 2]:  
                nums[left] = nums[right]
                left += 1
        return left 
```

## Debugging Example  

### Input:  
```python
nums = [2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5]
```

### Execution Steps:  

| Step | left | right | nums                           |
|------|------|------|----------------------------------|
| 1    | 2    | 2    | [2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5] |
| 2    | 2    | 3    | [2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5] |
| 3    | 3    | 4    | [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5] |
| 4    | 4    | 5    | [2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5] |
| 5    | 5    | 6    | [2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5] |
| 6    | 6    | 7    | [2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5] |

### Output:  
```
New length of nums: 7 
Modified nums: [2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5]
```
