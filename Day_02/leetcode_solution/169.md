# Solution

## Observation

A **naive** approach to solving this problem is to use a **dictionary (hash map)** to count occurrences of each element in `nums`. However, the problem constraints require **O(1) space** and **O(n) time complexity**, making this approach inefficient.

A key observation is that if the array is sorted, the **majority element** (appearing more than **⌊n / 2⌋** times) will always be located at the **middle index**. This observation leads to an **O(n log n) time** solution using sorting.

After further research, I found an even better approach: **Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm**, which achieves **O(n) time** and **O(1) space**. The algorithm leverages the frequency dominance of the majority element to identify it **without sorting or extra memory**.

### **How Boyer-Moore Voting Works**
1. Choose an initial **candidate** (start with the first element).
2. Traverse the array and:
   - Increase a **count** if the current element matches the candidate.
   - Decrease the **count** if it does not match.
   - If `count == 0`, change the candidate to the current element.
3. At the end of the loop, the remaining **candidate is the majority element**.

## Implementation

### **Naive Approach (Sorting & Counting)**
```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        """
        Naive approach: Sort and count occurrences
        """
        nums.sort()
        nums.append(float('inf'))  # Sentinel value to mark end
        index = 0

        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != nums[i - 1]:  # Value change detected
                if i - index > len(nums) // 2:  # Check if count > n/2
                    return nums[i - 1]
                index = i  # Update index for new value
```

- **Time Complexity:** **O(n log n)** (due to sorting)
- **Space Complexity:** **O(1)** (in-place sorting)

### **Optimized Sorting Approach (Direct Middle Access)**
```python
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        """
        Optimized approach: Sort and return the middle element
        """
        nums.sort()
        return nums[len(nums) // 2]
```

- **Time Complexity:** **O(n log n)**
- **Space Complexity:** **O(1)**

### **Best Approach (Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm)**
```python
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        """
        Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm (O(n) time, O(1) space)
        """
        count = 0
        candidate = None

        for num in nums:
            if count == 0:
                candidate = num  # Assign new candidate
            count += (1 if num == candidate else -1)

        return candidate
```

- **Time Complexity:** **O(n)**
- **Space Complexity:** **O(1)** (only a few extra variables)
