# Solution  

## Observation  

The problem requires us to maximize the profit from a single **buy-sell** transaction.  
A simple way to think about it is:  
- At each index `i`, we check the maximum profit if we **buy at the lowest price before index `i`**.
- We **update the minimum price** seen so far and calculate the possible profit.

This leads to an **O(n) time and O(1) space** approach.

## Implementation  

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        """
        Finds the maximum profit by buying and selling once.
        """
        profit = 0
        buy_value = float('inf')  # Initialize with a large value
        
        for price in prices:
            if price < buy_value:
                buy_value = price  # Update min buy price
            profit = max(profit, price - buy_value)  # Update max profit
            
        return profit
```

- **Time Complexity**: **O(n)** (Single loop through prices)
- **Space Complexity**: **O(1)** (Only a few extra variables)
