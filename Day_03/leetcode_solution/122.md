# Solution  

## Observation  

Unlike the previous problem (where we could only make **one** buy-sell transaction), here we can **buy and sell multiple times** to maximize the profit.  

- Instead of looking for the **single best buy-sell pair**, we **collect all positive gains** from consecutive days where `price[i] > price[i-1]`.  
- This is because if prices are increasing on consecutive days, the best strategy is to sell every time there is an increase.

## Implementation  

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        """
        Finds the maximum profit by making multiple buy-sell transactions.
        """
        profit = 0
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            if prices[i] > prices[i - 1]:  
                profit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1]  # Capture all upward movements
        return profit
```

- **Time Complexity**: **O(n)** (Single loop through prices)  
- **Space Complexity**: **O(1)** (No extra data structures used)
