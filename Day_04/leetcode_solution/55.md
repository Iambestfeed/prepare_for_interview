# Solution  

## Observation  

The problem essentially asks if we can jump from the first index to the last index. The idea is to track how far we can reach as we iterate through the array. At each position `i`, we can move to positions up to `i + nums[i]`. By continuously updating the farthest reachable position (`max_position`), we can determine if the last index is reachable.

### Key Insights:
- If we can reach position `i`, we can also potentially reach all positions from `i+1` to `i + nums[i]`.
- By updating `max_position` at each index, we can determine whether it's possible to reach the last index by the end of the loop.

## Implementation  

```python
class Solution:
    def canJump(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        if len(nums) <= 1:
            return True
        max_posision = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if i <= max_posision:
                max_posision = max(max_posision, i + nums[i])
        if max_posision >= len(nums) - 1:
            return True
        return False
```

- **Time Complexity**: **O(n)** (Single loop through prices)
- **Space Complexity**: **O(1)** (Only a few extra variables)
