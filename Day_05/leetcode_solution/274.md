# Solution  

## Observation  

The **H-Index** of a researcher is the maximum number `h` such that the researcher has at least `h` papers with at least `h` citations each.  

To compute this efficiently, we sort the citations in **descending order** and look for the first index where the citation count is **less than the index + 1**.  

### Key Insights:  
1. **Sorting in descending order** ensures that we can iterate from the highest citations downward.  
2. If `citations[i] >= i + 1`, then we can still increase the **H-Index**.  
3. The first time `citations[i] < i + 1`, we return `i` as the **H-Index**.  
4. If all papers have citations `>= len(citations)`, the H-Index is `len(citations)`.

## Implementation  

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def hIndex(self, citations: List[int]) -> int:
        citations.sort(reverse=True)  # Sort in descending order

        for i in range(len(citations)):
            if citations[i] < i + 1:  # First point where citations[i] is less than index + 1
                return i

        return len(citations)  # If all citations are high enough, return len(citations)
```

- **Time Complexity**: **O(n log n)** (Sort array)
- **Space Complexity**: **O(1)**
