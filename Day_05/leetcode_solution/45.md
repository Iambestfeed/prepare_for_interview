# Solution  

## Observation  

The problem requires us to find the **minimum number of jumps** to reach the last index. Instead of a brute-force approach, we use **greedy BFS-like traversal** to minimize jumps.  

### Key Insights:  
1. We maintain the **farthest position we can reach** (`max_position`).  
2. We keep track of the **current boundary** (`curr_end`), which is the furthest index reachable with the current number of jumps.  
3. Every time we reach `curr_end`, we **increase the jump count** and update `curr_end` to `max_position`.  
4. If `curr_end` reaches or exceeds the last index, we return the number of jumps.

## Implementation  

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def jump(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(nums) <= 1:
            return 0  # Already at the last index

        max_position = 0  # Farthest position reachable
        jumps = 0  # Jump counter
        curr_end = 0  # Current jump range

        for i in range(len(nums) - 1):  # Stop before the last index
            max_position = max(max_position, i + nums[i])  # Update farthest reach
            
            if i == curr_end:  # When we reach the current jump boundary
                jumps += 1
                curr_end = max_position  # Move to the next jump range
                
                if curr_end >= len(nums) - 1:  # If we can reach the last index
                    return jumps
        
        return jumps
```
