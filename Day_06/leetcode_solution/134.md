# **Solution Explanation**  

## **Observation**  
The problem requires finding a starting gas station **index** from which we can complete a full circuit without running out of gas.

### **Key Insights:**
1. If the **total gas available (`sum(gas)`) is less than the total cost (`sum(cost)`)**, **it is impossible** to complete the circuit. In that case, return `-1`.
2. Otherwise, there **must be** at least one valid starting index.
3. We iterate through `gas` and `cost`, tracking the **remaining fuel (`tank`)**:
   - If at any station `i`, `tank` becomes negative, it means **this station and all before it are invalid starting points**.
   - Reset `tank = 0` and set `start = i + 1` (try starting from the next station).

## **Implementation**  

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def canCompleteCircuit(self, gas: List[int], cost: List[int]) -> int:
        if sum(gas) < sum(cost):  
            return -1  # Not enough fuel overall
        
        tank, start = 0, 0
        for i in range(len(gas)):
            tank += gas[i] - cost[i]
            if tank < 0:  # Can't continue from this station
                tank = 0
                start = i + 1  # Try next station as starting point

        return start
```

## **Complexity Analysis**  
- **Time Complexity:** **O(n)** (Single pass through `gas` and `cost`)
- **Space Complexity:** **O(1)** (Only a few integer variables)
