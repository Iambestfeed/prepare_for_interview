# **Solution**  

## **Observation**  

The problem requires computing an output array where each element is the product of all elements in `nums` **except** itself, **without using division**.  

A key observation is that for each index `i`, the result can be expressed as:  

\[
\text{output}[i] = \text{product of elements before } i \times \text{product of elements after } i
\]

Instead of computing these separately with an extra **O(n)** space, we can optimize it by calculating:  
1. **Prefix product (left product)** while iterating left to right.  
2. **Suffix product (right product)** while iterating right to left.  
3. Storing results **in the output array itself**, making it an **O(1) extra space** solution.

## Implementation  

```python
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums)
        answer = [1] * n
        prefix = 1
        for i in range(n):
            answer[i] = prefix
            prefix *= nums[i]

        suffix = nums[-1]
        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            answer[i] *= suffix
            suffix *= nums[i]

        return answer

```

- **Time Complexity**: **O(n)** (Single loop through prices)
- **Space Complexity**: **O(1)** (Only a few extra variables)
