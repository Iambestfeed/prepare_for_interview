# **Solution**  

## **Problem Breakdown**
The goal is to distribute **candies** to children based on their ratings, following these rules:
1. Each child must have **at least one candy**.
2. A child with a **higher rating** than their neighbors must get **more candies** than them.

## **Approach 1: Two-Pass Greedy (O(n) time, O(n) space)**  
This approach ensures that the increasing and decreasing sequences are handled properly.

### **Implementation**
```python
class Solution:
    def candy(self, ratings: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(ratings)
        candies = [1] * n  # Each child gets at least 1 candy
        
        # Left-to-right pass (ensures increasing order condition)
        for i in range(1, n):
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]:
                candies[i] = candies[i - 1] + 1
        
        # Right-to-left pass (ensures decreasing order condition)
        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1]:
                candies[i] = max(candies[i], candies[i + 1] + 1)
        
        return sum(candies)
```

### **Complexity Analysis**
- **Time Complexity:** **O(n)** (Two linear passes)
- **Space Complexity:** **O(n)** (Extra array for `candies`)

---

## **Approach 2: One-Pass Greedy (O(n) time, O(1) space)**  
This approach eliminates the extra space by using variables to track the peak and valleys dynamically.

### **Implementation**
```python
class Solution:
    def candy(self, ratings: List[int]) -> int:
        candy = 1  # Start with one candy
        peek = 0
        up = 0
        down = 0
        n = len(ratings)
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]:  # Increasing slope
                up += 1
                down = 0
                peek = up
                candy += peek + 1
            elif ratings[i] < ratings[i - 1]:  # Decreasing slope
                up = 0
                down += 1
                candy += down + (1 if down > peek else 0)
            else:  # Equal ratings, reset slopes
                up = down = peek = 0
                candy += 1
        
        return candy
```

### **Complexity Analysis**
- **Time Complexity:** **O(n)** (Single loop through ratings)
- **Space Complexity:** **O(1)** (No extra space except variables)
