# Solution

## Observation  
The amount of water trapped at each position is determined by the minimum of the heights of the left and right walls, i.e., `min(height[l], height[r])` where `l` is the left boundary and `r` is the right boundary.  

Initially, I approached the problem using a dynamic programming (DP) approach, managing the trapped water using a `curr` variable to store the current height. After solving the problem, I then looked into a more optimized solution using the two-pointer technique.

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach (Solution 1)**:
   - The idea is to compute the maximum height at each position from both directions (left to right and right to left).
   - We use a `traps` array to store the maximum height observed up to each index.
   - By comparing the left and right heights, we can calculate how much water can be trapped at each index.

2. **Two-pointer Approach (Solution 2)**:
   - The two-pointer technique works by starting from both ends of the array and calculating the trapped water based on the minimum height between the two pointers.
   - As we move the pointers inward, we keep track of the maximum height encountered so far, and calculate the trapped water accordingly.
   - This solution runs in linear time and is much more space-efficient than the DP approach.

## Implement

### **Solution 1: Dynamic Programming Approach with a Trap Array**

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        # Initialize an array to store the maximum height at each position
        traps = [0] * len(height)
        
        # Set the first and last elements to their respective heights
        traps[0] = height[0]
        traps[-1] = height[-1]
        
        # Calculate the max height for each position from left to right
        curr = traps[0]
        for i in range(1, len(height) - 1):
            if height[i] > curr:
                traps[i] = height[i]
                curr = traps[i]
            else:
                traps[i] = curr
                
        print(traps)
        
        # Calculate the max height for each position from right to left
        curr = traps[-1]
        for i in range(len(height) - 2, -1, -1):
            if height[i] > curr:
                traps[i] = min(height[i], traps[i])
                curr = traps[i]
            else:
                traps[i] = min(curr, traps[i])
        
        print(traps)
        # Return the total trapped water by summing the difference between trapped water and heights
        return sum(traps) - sum(height)
```

### **Solution 2: Two-pointer Approach**

```python
class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        areas = 0
        max_l = max_r = 0
        l = 0
        r = len(height) - 1
        
        # Use two pointers to calculate the trapped water efficiently
        while l < r:
            if height[l] < height[r]:
                if height[l] > max_l:
                    max_l = height[l]
                else:
                    areas += max_l - height[l]
                l += 1
            else:
                if height[r] > max_r:
                    max_r = height[r]
                else:
                    areas += max_r - height[r]
                r -= 1
        return areas
```
