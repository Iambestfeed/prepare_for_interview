# Solution

## Observation
To efficiently process the string while maintaining order, we use a **stack-based approach**. The idea is to traverse the string character by character, performing the following actions:

- If the character is a **digit (0-9)**:
  - Remove the most recently added non-digit character (if available) from the stack.
- Otherwise (if it is a letter):
  - Push it onto the stack.

At the end of traversal, the stack will contain the final modified string with all required removals applied. The result is obtained by converting the stack back to a string.

## Implementation
```python
class Solution:
    def clearDigits(self, s: str) -> str:
        output = []
        for char in s:
            if char.isdigit():
                if output:
                    output.pop()  # Remove the last added character
            else:
                output.append(char)  # Add letter to stack
        return ''.join(output)
```
