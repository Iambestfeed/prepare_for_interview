# Solution

## **Observation**
We need to make all numbers in `nums` at least `k` by repeatedly combining the two smallest numbers. We do this using a **min-heap (priority queue)**:
1. **Extract the two smallest elements**.
2. **Create a new number** using the formula:  
   \[
   \text{new number} = 2 \times \min(x, y) + \max(x, y)
   \]
3. **Insert the new number back into the heap**.
4. **Repeat until the smallest number is at least `k`**.

### **Why a Min-Heap?**
- We always need the two smallest numbers → **heapq** provides `O(1)` access to the smallest element and `O(log n)` extraction/insertion.
- This ensures we efficiently process numbers in the correct order.

## **Implementation**
```python
import heapq
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        result = 0
        heapq.heapify(nums)  # Convert list into a min-heap

        while len(nums) > 1:
            x = heapq.heappop(nums)  # Smallest element
            if x >= k:
                return result  # If already >= k, return operations count

            y = heapq.heappop(nums)  # Second smallest element
            new_num = 2 * min(x, y) + max(x, y)  # Merge operation
            heapq.heappush(nums, new_num)  # Add back to heap
            result += 1  # Count operation

        return result if nums[0] >= k else -1  # If last element is still < k, return -1
```

## **Complexity Analysis**
- **Heapify (`heapq.heapify(nums)`)** → \( O(n) \)
- **Each operation (pop, push) is \( O(\log n) \)**.
- **Loop runs at most \( O(n) \) times** (each operation reduces elements).
- **Overall Complexity**:  
  \[
  O(n + n \log n) = O(n \log n)
  \]
  which is efficient for large inputs.
