```python
class Solution:
    def getHappyString(self, n: int, k: int) -> str:
        def dfs(pos: int, prev: str, k: int) -> str:
            # If we've built the full string, return it
            if pos == n:
                return prev

            # For each possible next character ('a', 'b', 'c')
            for c in ['a', 'b', 'c']:
                # Skip if this character is the same as the previous one
                if prev and prev[-1] == c:
                    continue

                # Count how many valid strings can start with prev + c
                # For the remaining positions, each can be any of 2 characters (not the previous)
                count = 2 ** (n - pos - 1) if n - pos - 1 > 0 else 1

                if k <= count:  # This is the start of our target string
                    return dfs(pos + 1, prev + c, k)
                else:  # Skip this branch
                    k -= count

            return ""  # No valid string found

        # Total number of happy strings is 3 * 2^(n-1)
        total = 3 * (1 << max(0, n - 1)) if n > 0 else 0
        if k > total or n <= 0:  # Invalid k or n
            return ""

        # Start DFS from empty string, position 0, with initial k
        return dfs(0, "", k)
