# **Solution**

## **Observation**
It's easy to observe that this is a problem of finding the first number in the range [0:2^n] that doesn't belong to the nums array.

## **Implementation**

```python
class Solution:
    def findDifferentBinaryString(self, nums: List[str]) -> str:
        def bi2de(num: str) -> int:
            base = 0
            for i in num:
                base = base * 2 + int(i)
            return base
        
        def de2bi(num: int) -> str:
            # Convert decimal to binary and remove '0b' prefix
            binary = bin(num)[2:]
            # Pad with leading zeros to match length of input strings
            return binary.zfill(len(nums[0]))
        
        # Convert all binary strings to decimal
        decimal_nums = set(bi2de(num) for num in nums)
        
        # Find first number not in set
        n = len(nums[0])  # length of binary strings
        for i in range(2**n):  # Check numbers from 0 to 2^n - 1
            if i not in decimal_nums:
                return de2bi(i)
```
