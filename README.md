# LeetCode Daily Challenge - Interview Preparation

Welcome to my **LeetCode Daily Challenge** repository! 🚀 This repository is dedicated to tracking my progress as I prepare for AI Engineer and Data Engineer interviews, focusing primarily on LeetCode problems. It is part of a broader series of interview preparation content, with the **100 Days of ML** as a parallel effort.

## 📌 Repository Structure

## 🚀 Challenge Format
Each day consists of:

1. **LeetCode Problem** 🧩
   - A Data Structures & Algorithms problem from LeetCode.
   - Explanation of the problem and solution approach.
   - Python implementation.

2. **(Parallel Content) 100 Days of ML** 📊
   - A separate initiative focusing on ML implementation.
   - Tracked in a different repository: [100 Days of ML](https://github.com/Iambestfeed/100days_ML_project)

## 🔥 How to Use
- Clone the repository:  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Iambestfeed/prepare_for_interview.git
  ```
- Navigate to the daily challenge folder.
- Read the `leetcode_problem.md` and check the `leetcode_solution.py` for the coding problem.

## 🏆 Goals
- Strengthen problem-solving skills in Data Structures & Algorithms.
- Build consistency in solving coding problems daily.
- Complement ML preparation with LeetCode practice.
